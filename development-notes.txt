
Development notes:

 * The code doesn't seem to build OK with devKitARM r38.
   It does however build right with devKitARM r37.
   With devKitARM >= 38 it might be necessary to tweak the
   Makefile (remove "no-fpu").

The source here was forked from the November 12, 2011 snapshot of 
clown3d.

The first phase of porting involved decreasing the
vertex count of all the models to make them "fit" on
the DS' limited GPU; I also made sure the engine's RAM
usage didn't exceed the DS' limit (4 MB, I think).
Finally, I had to store model files as char[]'s in source
files (could have been header files, more typical) and
implement a reader (string-read.c) because
you don't usually have a filesystem available on NDS.
(i.e. model data is stored directly as text in the game ROM.
the data-source directory contains the low-poly model files,
which are "compiled" to model-data.c via the "data2src"
script/program).

I then copy-pasted libnds 3D example code by Dovoto to
start porting to the libnds pseudo-GL API (and DS buttons,
timing, etc.)

Following that, several quirks in libnds had to be worked
around.

                           ----

Note that the current clown3D-ds can still be built for the
PC using either Makefile.pc or mingw-build.bat; to build the
libnds version use Makefile. The PC build shows a vertex count
and (optionally, see main.c) a RAM usage estimation.
