+ Good low-poly map
+ Low-poly player; optimized again
+ Store datafiles in sourcefiles !
  System for this set up. See data2src.sh script !
+ Why doesn't the player model ("turtle") appear ???!
  Fixed. read_float returned an int o_O
+ Low-poly and map-included bullets, keys, doors
+ Uses only about 42 KB of program (i.e. not video) RAM
  Also the model data only uses about 50 KB of ROM.
+ Ported to libnds (define PC_TARGET to build with SDL/GL,
   don't define it to build with libnds)
+ Works at 30 FPS regardless of platform; on DS, it's
  also VSync'd to this. (60 FPS is hard ! Famous programmer 
  John Carmack said so in some article).
+ The world map is messed up ! I have no idea why !
  Bug fixed: glVertex3f only accepts coordinates in a certain
  (small) range. A workaround for this quirk was added to
  model-draw.c; use drawModelWithGL_big(model*) to use this
  fixed version.
+ Optimizied key and door models; game runs at full speed
+ Improved NO$GBA's quality rating to "good"

+ *Test the game on real console !*
  The maze world loads & runs perfectly, but the 
  default world gives a black screen [FIXED].
  I suspect maxed out polygon count.

+ Get the default world to load on the real console.
