This is an *extremely work-in-progress*, non-finalized 
port to NDS (via the libnds API) of my 3d platformer engine, "clown3d". 
The source here was forked from the November 12, 2011 snapshot of 
clown3d.

It's worth mentioning:
The compiled ROM file is included here; it's "clown3d-DS.nds".
Also there is an early screenshot, "wip-screenshot.PNG".

Also, here are the controls:
	A button	shooting bullets
	B button	jumping
	D-pad		movement

The first phase of porting involved decreasing the
vertex count of all the models to make them "fit" on
the DS' limited GPU; I also made sure the engine's RAM
usage didn't exceed the DS' limit (4 MB, I think).
Finally, I had to store model files as char[]'s in source
files (could have been header files, more typical) and
implement a reader (string-read.c) because
you don't usually have a filesystem available on NDS.
(i.e. model data is stored directly as text in the game ROM.
the data-source directory contains the low-poly model files,
which are "compiled" to source files [*-mdl.c] via the "data2src"
script/program).

I then copy-pasted libnds 3D example code by Dovoto to
start porting to the libnds pseudo-GL API (and DS buttons,
timing, etc.)

Following that, several quirks in libnds had to be worked
around.

Right now, I'm still trying to improve the graphics and
optimize the code. I have yet to test the program on a
real console.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the current clown3D-ds can still be built for the
PC using either Makefile.pc or mingw-build.bat; to build the
libnds version use Makefile. The PC build shows a vertex count
and (optionally, see main.c) a RAM usage estimation.
