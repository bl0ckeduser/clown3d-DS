This is a port to NDS of my 3d platformer engine, "clown3d".

The development environment used is the devKitPro toolchain
and libnds (both available at http://devkitpro.org).

Big thanks to Dovoto for the useful example code 
and to mtheall for the technical support.

- The compiled ROM file is included here; it's "clown3d-DS.nds".
- All the game data and code is stored within the .nds file, no other
  files are needed to run the game. There is no DLDI, so DLDI patching
  is not necessary.
- Screenshot: "wip-screenshot.PNG".
- Works fully on real console and most emulators

The game controls are:
	A button	jumping
	B button	shooting bullets
	D-pad		movement
